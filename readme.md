# Roman Rymar's website :camera:
Website created for Roman Rymar, actor based in Madrid.

## Structure
The web works as a portfolio, and is divided into a landing page, a biography and photo and video gallery. It has been built using Zurb Foundation stack.

So far, the web is static and it's served thanks to Github pages.

## Usage
If you want to run it locally just clone the repo and open the HTML files in the browser. Alternatively, you can start the developer mode running
```sh
npm install
```

and then
```sh
npm start
```
You can try the webapp without cloning [here](http://www.romanrymar.com/)

## Contributing

If you fancy, you can make a pull request and improve the functionality or even the UI of the site.
